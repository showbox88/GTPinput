## 🤖 Custom GPT Logic

The GPT acts as a **Daily Expense Assistant**.

### Trigger Rule

If user input contains a monetary amount (e.g. `22`, `22块`, `$22`), the GPT **automatically records an expense**.

### Tool Call Format

```json
{
  "amount": 22,
  "category": "Food",
  "description": "Lunch takeout",
  "date": "2026-02-03"
}
☁️ Cloudflare Worker
Responsibilities
